As this exercise focuses on implementation, rather than architecture, I decided to simplify the requirements so I can invest more in implementation.

- No environment support.
- Permission is determined  by the organization. If user belongs to the organization, he/she can access all projects belonging to the organization.

# TODO (in this order)
- Add pre-commit and fix code style accordingly.
  - Docstrings?
  - Naming conventions?
- Add GitHub actions to run tests and build project.
- Change all functions to accept both objects and object IDs.
- Add more tests.
- Complete implementation.
